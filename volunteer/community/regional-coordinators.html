	<h2>Regional Coordinator Overview</h2>
	<p>Around the world, Carpentries workshops are organized by a team of Regional Coordinators. Regional Coordinators are the front face of The Carpentries, promoting our work and our culture in their geographical area. They manage workshop logistics, communicate with hosts and Instructors, and respond to general inquiries. The Regional Coordinators work together to support each other and ensure communities can thrive locally while maintaining quality and consistency globally.</p>
