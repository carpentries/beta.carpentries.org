	<h2>Maintainer Overview</h2>
	<p>The Carpentries Maintainers work with the community to make sure that lessons stay up-to-date, accurate, functional and cohesive. Maintainers monitor their lesson repository, make sure that pull requests and issues are addressed in a timely manner, and participate in the lesson development cycle including lesson releases. They endeavor to be welcoming and supportive of contributions from all members of the community.</p>
	<p>This community of practice is a great place to learn to collaborate effectively in Git and GitHub.</p>
