	<h2>Community Overview</h2>
	<p>The Carpentries works to help institutions and individuals spread skills for data analysis, computational thinking, and research software development through building local and global communities of practice.</p>
	<p>We remain a nearly all-volunteer organization. Our work is made possible by the efforts of our amazing volunteers, workshop hosts and organisers, community champions, member organisations, and Core Team (paid staff).</p>
