    <h3>Tiered-Pricing Based On Geographic Location</h3>
    <p>All fees are dependent on the purchasing organisation's geographic location, according to the <a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html" class="underline">World Bank's gross national income categorisation</a>. All fees listed are in USD and represent costs for not-for-profit organisations and academic institutions. Pricing for for-profit organisations is four times the price listed for non-profit organisations.</p>
    <h3>Travel Expenses for Instructors</h3>
    <p>The instructors selected to teach workshops are volunteers and are not paid for their service. To compensate for their time we require the Host to cover travel expenses (for in-person workshops only). We work to find local instructors and minimize expenses, but we recommend that you estimate about $2000 total ($1000 per Instructor) for the travel, food, and accommodation of the instructors. Once the instructors and workshop date are finalized, you can communicate your process for reimbursement directly with the instructors.</p>
