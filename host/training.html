	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Carpentries Instructor Training gives you strategies to teach coding and data workshops. Our 16-hour hands-on training teaches the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. During the training, you will practise these new skills while getting to know others who share your interests.</p>
	<p>After the training, you may complete three "checkout" steps to become a Certified Carpentries Instructor. Certified Instructors can volunteer to teach at our "centrally-organised workshops" with our global community virtually or in-person. They are also able to organise Carpentries workshops for their local community.</p>
    <h3>Why Instructor Training?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Trainees do not needed previous experience.</strong> Something here to speak to why trainees with no previous experience will still excel.</li>
		<li><strong>Evidence-Based Teaching Practices.</strong> Your Trainees will learn evidence-based teaching practices to be more effective both in Carpentries workshops and teaching more broadly.</li>
        <li><strong>Create An Inclusive Classroom.</strong> Trainees leave with tools to create a positive classroom environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Become A Certified Carpentries Instructor.</strong>  Being a Carpentries Instructor is a great professional development opportunity for your Instructors. Carpentries credentials can elevate their profile and yours on the global stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Impact.</strong> Instructors have the option to team up with other colleagues to self-organise Carpentries workshops that address the coding or data needs of their peers. Instructors can lead the way to improve coding and data skills of your organisation.</li>
        <li><strong>Networking.</strong> When Instructors join an instructional team, they create connections that can benefit your institution and combat isolation across departments and professional communities around the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Live Practice</strong> Instructor Training does not end with certification! Team teaching, along with Carpentries surveys and formative assessment practices, facilitate continued development of your Instructorsâ€™ teaching skills.</li>
