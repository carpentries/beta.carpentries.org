	<h3>Open Instructor Training</h3>

<div class="section" id="cancellation">
    <h2>Attendance & Cancellation Policies</h2>
	<p>Trainees who miss more than 1 hour of an Instructor Training event may be marked absent. Instructor certification cannot be completed without full attendance at an Instructor Training event. Please be sure to verify your availability for the full instructional time of your event. If you expect to miss more than a total of 1 hour, please select a different event.</p>
    <p>To support our program and honor the time donated by our Instructor Trainers, we ask that cancellations be made as far in advance as possible to allow other trainees to register before the 1 week deadline. If a trainee repeatedly registers and cancels (>3 times), or registers for more than one seat at the same time, they may be barred from further registration.</p>
    <p>Trainees may cancel their registration directly within Eventbrite or via a link in the event confirmation email. After a registration has been cancelled in Eventbrite, the code that was used to register will become available to sign up for a different event.</p>
    <p>More details on our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/cancellations_and_makeups.html" class="underline"></a>cancellation and makeup policy are available in The Carpentries Handbook.</p>
