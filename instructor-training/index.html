	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Carpentries Instructor Training gives you strategies to teach coding and data workshops. Our 16-hour hands-on training teaches the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. During the training, you will practise these new skills while getting to know others who share your interests.</p>
	<p>After the training, you may complete three "checkout" steps to become a Certified Carpentries Instructor. Certified Instructors can volunteer to teach at our "centrally-organised workshops" with our global community virtually or in-person. They are also able to organise Carpentries workshops for their local community.</p>
