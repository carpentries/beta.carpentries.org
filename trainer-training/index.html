	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Instructor Trainers (Trainers) teach The Carpentries Instructor Training Events. They train new Instructors in the basics of educational psychology and evidence-based teaching practices. They also support and play a leadership role in the oversight of the Instructor Training program.</p>
	<p>Instructor Trainer Training is the process by which we onboard new Instructor Trainers. The training consists of 10 weekly 1-hour sessions, where we will discuss The Carpentries teaching philosophy and review supporting materials summarising the research that underpins our Instructor Training curriculum.</p>

    <h3>Prior Instructor Certification</h3>
    <p>If you are not a certified Carpentries Instructor, please expect a larger time committment when becoming a certified Trainer. While being a certified Carpentries Instructor is not a pre-requisite to being accepted in the Trainer Training program, we do require that all Trainers be certified Carpentries Instructors. If you are not a certified Carpentries Instructor before being accepted into the Trainer Training program, you will be required to complete the Instructor Training Program and become a certified Instructor for your after training certification steps.</p>
    <p>If you are not a certified Carpentries Instructor and you are interested in becoming a Trainer, we encourage you to become an Instructor while you wait for Trainer Training applications to open.</p>

Trainers can maintain their active certification status by participating in the following activities as their schedule allows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Teaching Instructor Training</li>
        <li>Hosting Teaching Demonstrations</li>
