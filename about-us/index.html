	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Carpentries is a mission-driven nonprofit project that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. We exist because the skills needed to do computational, data-intensive research are often not included as a part of basic research training in many disciplines. Our global community works together to provide:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A suite of open source, collaboratively-built, community-developed lessons</li>
		<li>Evidence-based, proven pedagogical training</li>
		<li>Workshops based on a learn-by-doing, ‘code with me’ approach</li>
		<li>A supportive learning culture</li>
		<li>A global community which subscribes to an inclusive code of conduct</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	<p>Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our_mission">
	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and supporting research.</p>

<div class="section" id="our_values">
	<h2>Our Values</h2>
	<p>Shared values and goals have long been the starting point of communities of practice as they identify changes they want to see and start working together towards these changes. The Carpentries community share nine core values.</p>

<div class="section" id="our_work">
	<h2>Our Work</h2>
	<p>The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are held together by a small <a href="#" class="underline">Core Team</a>, but the majority of our impact is achieved through the efforts of volunteer participants in our global and local communities. The global Carpentries community consists of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, Lesson Developers, Member Organisations, committee or task force members, and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share.</p>

	<h3>Lesson Programs</h3>
	<p>Lesson Programs are collections of lessons comprising one or more Carpentries workshops, serving distinct goals and audience, and the leadership guiding their development and implementation.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Software Carpentry</b>: Software Carpentry enables researchers to create purpose-built tools, whether it be a Unix shell script to automate repetitive tasks, or software code in programming languages such as Python, R, or MATLAB. These enable researchers to build programs that can be read, re-used, and validated, greatly enhancing the sharing and reproducibility of their research.</li>
		<li><b>Data Carpentry</b>: Data Carpentry learners are taught to work with data more effectively. Workshops focus on the data lifecycle, covering data organization, cleaning and management through to data analysis and visualization. Lessons are domain-specific, with coverage in biology, genomics, and social sciences.</li>
		<li><b>Library Carpentry</b>: Library Carpentry focuses on building software and data skills within library and information-related communities.</li>
	</ul>

<div class="section" id="our_history">
	<h2>Our History</h2>
	<p>We have a rich history that dates back to 1998 when <a href="#" class="underline">Software Carpentry</a> was founded with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing. At that time, Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda taught workshops to teach researchers software development skills. Greg continued this work, building a collection of collaboratively-developed and openly-available lessons, as well as community of instructors who used those lessons to teach workshops.</p>
	<p>In 2014, <a href="#" class="underline">Data Carpentry</a> was founded with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy. Also in 2014, <a href="#" class="underline">Library Carpentry</a> was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles. Each organisation working in tandem and in partnership to develop lessons and build global communities of practice.</p>
	<p>In 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged their projects to form a new project called The Carpentries, under the fiscal sponsorship of <a href="https://communityin.org/" class="underline">Community Initiatives</a>, and shortly thereafter welcomed Library Carpentry as a Lesson Program.</p>
